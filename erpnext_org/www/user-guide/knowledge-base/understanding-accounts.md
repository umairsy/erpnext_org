Chart of Accounts represents a tree like representation of all accounting
heads, used to represent company's financial information. There are two types
of accounts: Balance Sheet and Profit and Loss Statement accounts. Balance
Sheet consists of Assets and Liabilities accounts and Profit and Loss
Statement accounts consists of Incomes and Expenses.

**Assets:** Bank and Cash balances, outstanding amounts of customers and all other assets are recorded here.

**Liabilities:** All the company's liabilities like shareholder's capital, outstanding amount to be paid to suppliers, taxes to be paid to concerned to authorities are recorded under this group.

**Income:** Income from direct/indirect sales.

**Expenses:** All the expenses to run the business, like salaries, purchases, rent etc. are recorded here.

### Debit and Credit

Each of these accounts are either "Debit" or "Credit" type. Assets, Expenses
are "Debit" accounts and Liabilities, Incomes are "Credit" accounts.

Accounting Entries

The balance of account can be increased / decreased, depending on account type
and transaction type.

<table class="table table-bordered text-center">
    <thead>
        <tr class="active">
            <td>Account Type</td>
            <td>Transaction Type</td>
            <td>Effect on account balance</td>
        </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td>Debit</td>
            <td>Debit</td>
            <td>Increases</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Debit</td>
            <td>Credit</td>
            <td>Decreases</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Credit</td>
            <td>Credit</td>
            <td>Increases</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Credit</td>
            <td>Debit</td>
            <td>Decreases</td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

### Double Entry

This means that every accounting entry has two parts, one debit and one credit
and must affect two separate accounts. If you add or deduct to one account,
some other account somewhere else must also be affected. See the example
below:

  1. Company sells a laptop worth 50000 to Customer A and delivers that with an invoice.

As the company will receive a payment from customer, the customer is
considered as an asset account. For booking income, company maintains an
account called "Sales of Laptop". So, entries will be done in the following
manner:

<table class="table table-bordered text-center">
    <thead>
        <tr class="active">
            <td>Account</td>
            <td>Debit</td>
            <td>Credit</td>
        </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td>Customer A</td>
            <td>50000</td>
            <td></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Sales of Laptop</td>
            <td></td>
            <td>50000</td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>
Customer A has made the payment, so customer balance should decreased based on
the paid amount, which will increase "Cash" balance.

<table class="table table-bordered text-center">
    <thead>
        <tr class="active">
            <td>Account</td>
            <td>Debit</td>
            <td>Credit</td>
        </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td>Customer A</td>
            <td></td>
            <td>50000</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Cash</td>
            <td>50000</td>
            <td></td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>
