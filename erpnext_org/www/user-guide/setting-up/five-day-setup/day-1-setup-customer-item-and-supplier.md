# Day 1: Set up Customer, Item and Supplier

<p class="lead"> To begin using ERPNext it is essential to set up a few pages of Customers, Items and Suppliers.</p>


If you have entered the Customer, Supplier and Item details in the setup wizard, the system will automatically update them for you. In case for some reason you have not done so, not to worry. You can start filling the details based on the explanation given below.

### Customer

To create a Customer go to the Selling module and click on Customer;

> Selling > Customer > New Customer

Fill the Item form. An Item is your company's product or a service. The term
Item is applicable to your core products as well as your raw materials. It can
be a product or service that you buy/sell from your Customers/Suppliers.

Filling Item details is an important step in ERPNext. Do not postpone this
step. After clicking on Item, make a new Item.

> Note: This form will not be saved if Warehouse details are not entered.

To understand how to fill an Item in detail, visit [Item](/user-guide/stock/item-master). Add 5 Item records to ERPnext. After adding these records, go back to the Setup Page and add Suppliers.

  
### Suppliers

To create Suppliers, go to the main menu and click on Buying module. Then click on the icon Supplier.

> Buying > Supplier > New Supplier
