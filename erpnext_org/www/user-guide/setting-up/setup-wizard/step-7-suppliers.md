#### Difference between a supplier name and a contact name.

Suppliers are companies or individuals who provide you with products or services. A supplier name is the name of the supplier company. Contact name is the name of the person who supplies you the product.

For Example. If A.K Enterprises is a supplier of Jute fabrics and Jute wires and Mr. John Carvalho of A.K Enterprises provides supplies to you; then, supplier name will be A.K Enterprises and John Carvalho will be the contact name.
