#### In Sales Transactions

Sales transactions (Sales Order, Sales Invoice) can be allocated to Sales Person(s). This allows you tracking sales made by each Sales Person over a period. You can use this as yardstick to determine their appraisal and allowances.

> In sales transactions, Contribution should amount to 100% combining all the Sales Persons. If only one Sales Person selected in the transaction, set Contribution % as 100.
