Completing the selling setup is an important step in ERPNext. You need to
identify whether you would like to name your customers with their Customer
Name or with Serial No. Also, specify whether all the sales transactions have
to be accompanied with Sales Order and Delivery Note. Specify your Default
Customer Group and the Default Territory you operate in.
