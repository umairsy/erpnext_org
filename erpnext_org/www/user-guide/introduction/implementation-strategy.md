Before you start managing your Operations in EPRNext, you must first become
familiar with the system and the terms used. For this we recommend
implementation should happen in two phases.

  * A Test Phase, where you enter dummy records representing your day to day transactions and a - Live Phase, where we start entering live data.

### Test Phase

  * Read the Manual
  * Follow the Five-Day-Setup Module or the instructions given below.
  * Create your first Customer, Supplier and Item. Add a few more so you get familiar with them.
  * Create Customer Groups, Item Groups, Warehouses, Supplier Groups, so that you can classify your Items.
  * Complete a standard sales cycle - Lead > Opportunity > Quotation > Sales Order > Delivery Note > Sales Invoice > Payment (Journal Voucher)
  * Complete a standard purchase cycle - Material Request > Purchase Order > Purchase Receipt > Payment (Journal Voucher).
  * Complete a manufacturing cycle (if applicable) - BOM > Production Planning Tool > Production Order > Material Issue > Sales Return

> Tip: Use the 30-day free trial at [frappecloud.com](https://frappecloud.com) to take
your test drive.

### Live Phase
