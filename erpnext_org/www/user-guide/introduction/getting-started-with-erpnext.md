There are many ways to get started with ERPNext.

### 1\. See the Demo

If you want to check out the user interface and **feel** the application, just
see the demo at:

  * <https://demo.frappecloud.com>

### 2\. Get a Free 30 day Trial at FrappeCloud.com

If you like the feel and want to set it up for your own company, you can take
a 30 day free trial (no credit card details required) at FrappeCloud.com

FrappeCloud.com is managed by the organization (Web Notes) that publishes ERPNext.
You can do a trial run with your own account by [signing up on the
website](https://frappecloud.com).

You can also decide to host your application at FrappeCloud.com by buying the
hosting plans. This way you support the organization that develops and
improves ERPNext. You also get one-to-one functional (usage) support with the
hosting plans.

### 3\. Download a Virtual Machine

To avoid the trouble of installing an instance, ERPNext is available as a
Virtual Image (a full loaded operating system with ERPNext installed). You can
use this on **any** platform including Microsoft Windows.
