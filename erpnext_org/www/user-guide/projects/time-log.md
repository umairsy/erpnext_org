## Time Sheets

You can create Time Sheets to track billable work to Customers. These Time
Sheets can be tracked against Project and Tasks so that you can get reports on
how much time was spent on each Task or Project.

Time Logs are a way to track time worked on Tasks or Projects. Time Logs can also be grouped together, or "Batched" for billing. This way you can track whether Time Logs are billed or not. Time Logs replace the earlier Timesheet Transaction and can also be represented in a Calendar Format.

__Step 1: Create a new Time Log__

In the Time Log, define the Activity Type (this is an easy way to identify the type of activity) and update the Project or Task it is worked on. If the Time is billable to the Customer, check the "Billable" box.

__Step 2. Batching Time Logs for Billing__

You can bill Time Logs by batching them together. This gives you the flexiblity to manage your customer billing in the way you want. To create a new Time Log Batch, go to Projects > Time Log Batch > New Time Log Batch

OR

Just open your Time Log list and check the Items to you want to add to the Time Log. Then click on "Make Time Log Batch" button and these Time Logs will be selected.

After submitting the Time Log Batch, click on the "Make Invoice" button. When you click on that button, a new Sales Invoice will open with the total number of hours as "Quantity".

Notice that the Time Log Batch number is already updated in the Time Log Batch column and this will be the link of this Invoice to the Time Logs.

When you "Submit" the Sales Invoice, the Sales Invoice number will get updated in the Time Logs and Time Log Batch and their status will change to "Billed".
