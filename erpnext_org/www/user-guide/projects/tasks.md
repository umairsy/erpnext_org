## Tasks

Project is divided into Tasks and each Task is allocated to a resource. In
ERPNext, you can also create and allocate a Task independently of a Project.
If you define the start and end dates, it will add calendar events for the
same and also show the task on the Gantt Chart that you can use for monitoring
the Project.
