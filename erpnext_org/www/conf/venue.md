<img src="/assets/erpnext_org/images/conf/erpnext-conf-14.png" class="img-responsive">

The ERPNext Conference will be held in the quaint and quirky neighbourhood in Mumbai called Matunga. Matunga is the hub of the South Indian community in Mumbai and is famous for its Cafes, Book Stalls, Temples and Cultural Shops. Its down-to-earth, quality-and-consistency and value-for-money ethic is exactly what ERPNext is all about.

Matunga was also one of the first planned residential parts of the city and is home to some [beautiful Art Deco buildings](http://thatandthisinmumbai.wordpress.com/2014/05/29/neighbourhoods-of-mumbai-1-matunga/).

### Cafes

Popularly known as "Udupi" Cafes, Matunga is dotted with dozens of small eateries that serve high quality South Indian snacks such as dosa and idli along with the famous filter coffee. These cafes pride in providing consistently high quality food at very affordable prices. So instead of paying high money to five-star hotels, we decided that we need to here

Here are some beautiful pics from Flickr (Creative Commons) to whet your appetite.

See you at the conference!
