# Manufacturing

### Introduction

If you are a manufacturer and wish to get a system that will manage Inventory and Warehouse, Production Orders, Stock , Billing and other business functions, you should try ERPNext.


### Manufacturing Management

1. **Calculate Production Costs:** The Bill of Materials (BoM) form gives the total cost of manufacturing or acquiring an Item at a glance and determines the valuation of that product.
2. **Prepare Multi-level Bill of Materials:** Manage hierarchical Bill of Materials and Operations for all sub-assemblies and final assemblies. Calculate resulting production costs.
3. **Plan for Material Shortages:** The data captured in the BoM form provides accurate information needed for scheduling material requirements.
4. **Make Production Plans:** Use existing Sales Orders and plan for material procurement and operations management.
5. **Purchase and Supply Chain Management:** Raise Material Requests. Users across other departments can raise material requests and purchase orders as per their requirements.
6. **Use Multi-Currency :** Raise Purchase Orders in supplier’s currency as well as your company’s currency based on an exchange rate.
7. **Pricing:** You can design and store different price lists based on currency, location, customers and suppliers.
8. **Configure Taxes and Tax Templates:** Different types of taxes like VAT, CENVAT, Purchase Tax, Sales Tax, Shipping Costs etc. can be configured and attached to a purchase or a sale.
9. **Track Pending Orders:** Orders which are not delivered by the suppliers can be tracked easily. Mechanism for sending reminders to suppliers and maintaining their communication history is available in ERPNext.
10. **Avoid Out-of-Stock:** Material requests help you to identify items you need to purchase and can be created by manual entry, from a Production Plan or automatically, from an item that crosses its re-order level.

### Inventory and Warehouse Management

1. **Setup Multiple Warehouses:** In ERPNext you can configure multiple warehouses for multiple products. Separate warehouses for finished goods and unfinished goods can be maintained. A workstation or warehouse for goods in production or assimilation can be provided.
1. **Automate Accounting of Stock Transactions:** Perpetual Inventory system will make it easier for you to maintain accuracy of company's assets and expenses. Stock balances will always be in sync with relevant account balances. It is a more accurate alternative to manually making periodic entries to balance accounts.
1. **Create Backdated Stock Transactions:** Future Stock Ledger Entries and General Ledger Entries get recalculated for all products of that transaction. Cancellations or amendment of existing transactions can be managed easily.
1. **Monitor Warranty and Traceability:** Maintain a database of unique Serial Numbers for products that require traceability. Keep track of warranties for multiple maintenance contracts.
