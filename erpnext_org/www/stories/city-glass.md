# City Glass, Egypt

Egypt was in the middle of a social revolution when we had a dialogue with Mr.
Hisham Farid, IT Manager of City Glass. He assured us that business was not
restricted and the situation there, was under control. For offices and
factories business was regular. There were no shutdowns or holidays. Amidst this widespread unrest, looking at the company and its march gives us comfort that a company can continue doing business even in such turbulent times.

#### Company and Products

City Glass is a manufacturer and exporter of handmade and automated glass
tableware in Egypt. It is a major player and valued supplier of glassware
products. They export 80% of their production to Iraq, KSA Syria, Jordan,
Palestine, Sudan, Libya, Morocco, Italy, Spain, Germany, USA & Mexico. They
also have their own network in Turkey, Italy, and USA.

This company started as a very small glass factory. They used manual
techniques to produce glasses. Later, they adopted German technology and
produced 5 tons per day. Within a few years they established two more
factories. Their current production limit is 120 tons a day. This is a company that moved on from old technology and embraced modern production lines. When they migrated and expanded their operations, their information technology systems also needed an upgrade.

#### The Challenges

They were operating on an Egyptian software to maintain all their data. The
three factories, their accounting transactions, different operational
processes, and numerous employee records had become a herculean task to
manage. They felt the need for a software that could integrate all their
operations and data.

Their IT manager, Mr. Hisham Farid, had good experience
with Oracle so he decided to get an ERP system for the company. However, he
knew that Oracle was not suited for a medium-sized company like City Glass. He
needed something that would manage a medium-sized enterprise with an easy to
use interface. After some research he came across ERPNext.

#### The Solution

"ERPNext is very simple and integrated. It is very easy and customisable. It
doesn't need any costly and complex hardware installation. We also have some
users who used to previously work on SAP and they said that this system is
better and easier for them and gives them all they need in a better way" said Mr.Hisham Farid. He went against the standard convention of implementing a proprietary and costly software and decided to embrace an open-source solution for his
company. With ERPNext, he was able to do away with heavy installations and
consultation charges. He is a happy man and pleased with his decision.

#### ERPNext Experience

We inquired whether he faced any resistance from the company employees to
adopt ERPNext. He said "Initially there was a lot of resistance to implement from old Microsoft users. However, they migrated after they saw a simple and easy way to run an application".

Hisham Farid shared his experience on customisation. He said that "Initially, the manufacturing department was reluctant to adapt to a new software. Their Quality Team had a special quality check form that needed to be filled before production began. The form that ERPNext provided did not have all the specifications that City Glass needed. However, it was easy to
customise ERPNext to add these missing fields". After operating ERPNext for
some time, their teams realised that ERPNext is pretty easy to navigate and
gave seamless integration with other functional departments.

Today, City Glass has successfully migrated all their operations, along with
their subsidiaries, to ERPNext. They are using normal ADSL lines to work with
their factories and Head office, and confirm that they are very happy with the
speed of operations. They insist that ERPNext doesn't need any costly and
complex hardware installation. They are using a normal Dell server which costs
one-third of other servers like Microsoft Dynamics or Oracle E-Business suit.
Even their ex-SAP users say "ERPNext system is better and easier to use". They
are happy with ERPNext and so are we. They are our first **donors**.
