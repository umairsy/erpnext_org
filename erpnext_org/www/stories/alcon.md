#### ERPNext Experience

Ms. Zel Ortiz is happy with ERPNext. She said;

> After trying so many ERP's, what I liked is the completeness and ease of use of ERPnext. Other ERP’s are very hard to use and learn” At Alcon, people were used to working on traditional excel / word files. It was difficult to get everybody to use ERPNext, which was based on an open source platform; However, they came around when they saw a user-friendly interface.

When we asked Ms. Zel, which is her favourite feature in ERPNext? She said,
**all of them!**
